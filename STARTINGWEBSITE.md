__For Some reason the backand need to be run first for the website to run properly__
Requires some python libraries: (we used a python env for this)
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Then cd into `./backend`
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

__For the frontend__
cd into './frontend'
then 
`npm i`
and finally `npm run dev`
